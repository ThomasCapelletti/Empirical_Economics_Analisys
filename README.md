# Empirical_Economics_analysis
How Debt Affects Economic Growth - Empirical Economics sought to make a comparison between a developing country (Mexico) and a developed country (Japan) on some debt indicators. Through the results, an attempt was made to define how debt affects a country's economic growth.
